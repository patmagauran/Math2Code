This is a way to easily enter equations and get them output in various formats.

Goals for output include:
 - LaTeX
 - MathML
 - Python
 - Excel
 - Java(Double)
 - Java(BigDecimal)
 - Possibly Others

This relies on the following technologies:
 - React
 - Mathquill and react-mathquill
 - Next.JS


Future Plans include 
 - Creating fully working code(Each equation represents a function with parameters) including imports
 - Support for specifying Variable types for each and including type casting automatically
 - Generate a full excel table with defined columns for each variable and a separate set of constant values for defined constants
 - The ability to simplify equations
